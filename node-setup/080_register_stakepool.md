# Register a Stake Pool with Metadata

__USE TAG: 1.14.2__ 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have access to:

* One or more funded addresses.
* The keys and operational certificate for the stake pool.
* The stake keys.

At this moment we have:

    | File           | Content                           |
    | -------------- | --------------------------------  |
    | `payment.vkey` | payment verification key          |
    | `payment.skey` | payment signing key               |
    | `stake.vkey`   | staking verification key          |
    | `stake.skey`   | staking signing key               |
    | `stake.addr`   | registered stake address          |
    | `payment.addr` | funded address linked to `stake`  |
    | `cold.vkey`    | cold verification key             |
    | `cold.skey`    | cold signing key                  |
    | `cold.counter` | issue counter                     |
    | `node.cert`    | operational certificate           |
    | `kes.vkey`     | KES verification key              |
    | `kes.skey`     | KES signing key                   |
    | `vrf.vkey`     | VRF verification key              |
    | `vrf.skey`     | VRF signing key                   |


Registering your stake pool requires:

* Create JSON file with your metadata and store it in the node and in a url you maintain.
* Get the hash of your JSON file
* Generate the stake pool registration certificate
* Create a delegation certificate (pledge)
* Submit the certificates to the blockchain
* Submit a PR with pool metadata (Temporary step until DB-sync is upgraded)

**WARNING:** Generating the __stake pool registration certificate__ and the __delegation certificate__ requires the __cold keys__ So, you may want to generate these certificates in your local machine taking the proper security measures to avoid exposing your cold keys to the internet.  

### 1. Create a JSON file with your pool's metadata

    {
    "name": "TestPool",
    "description": "The pool that tests all the pools",
    "ticker": "TEST",
    "homepage": "https://teststakepool.com"
    }

Store the file in a url you control, for example [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/testPool/.../testPool.json](shorturl.at/gDV47)

### 2. Get the hash of your file:

This validates that the JSON fits the required schema, if it does, you will get the hash of your file. 

    cardano-cli shelley stake-pool metadata-hash --pool-metadata-file testPool.json

### 3. Generate Stake pool registration certificate

Create a _stake pool registration certificate_:

    cardano-cli shelley stake-pool registration-certificate \
    --cold-verification-key-file cold.vkey \
    --vrf-verification-key-file vrf.vkey \
    --pool-pledge 1000000000 \
    --pool-cost 100000000 \
    --pool-margin 0.05 \
    --pool-reward-account-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
    --pool-owner-stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
    --testnet-magic 42 \
    --pool-relay-port 3001 \
    --pool-relay-ipv4 123.123.123.123 \
    --metadata-url https://gist.githubusercontent.com/testPool/.../testPool.json \
    --metadata-hash 6bf124f217d0e5a0a8adb1dbd8540e1334280d49ab861127868339f43b3948af \
    --out-file pool.cert

| Parameter                            | Explanation                                       |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| stake-pool-verification-key-file     | verification _cold_ key                           |
| vrf-verification-key-file            | verification _VRS_ key                            |
| pool-pledge                          | pledge (lovelace)                                 |
| pool-cost                            | operational costs per epoch (lovelace)            |
| pool-margin                          | operator margin                                   |
| pool-reward-account-verification-key-file | verification staking key for the rewards          |
| pool-owner-staking-verification-key-file  | verification staking key(s) for the pool owner(s) |
| out-file                             | output file to write the certificate to           |
| pool-relay-port                      | port                                              |
| pool-relay-ipv4                      | relay node ip address                             |
| metadata-url                         | url of your json file                             |
| metadata-hash                        | the hash of pools json metadata file              |


So in the example above, we use the cold- and VRF-keys that we created [here](060_node_keys.md),
promise to pledge 10000 ada to our pool, declare operational costs of 100 ada per epoch,
set the operational margin (i.e. the ratio of rewards we take after taking our costs and before the rest is distributed amongst owners and delegators
according to their delegated stake) to 5%, use the staking key we created [here](020_keys_and_addresses.md) to receive our rewards
and use the same key as pool owner key for the pledge.

We could use a different key for the rewards, and we could provide more than one owner key if there were multiple owners who share the pledge.

The __pool.cert__ file should look like this:

    type: StakePoolCertificateShelley
    title: Free form text
    cbor-hex:
    18b58a03582062d632e7ee8a83769bc108e3e42a674d8cb242d7375fc2d97db9b4dd6eded6fd5820
    48aa7b2c8deb8f6d2318e3bf3df885e22d5d63788153e7f4040c33ecae15d3e61b0000005d21dba0
    001b000000012a05f200d81e820001820058203a4e813b6340dc790f772b3d433ce1c371d5c5f5de
    46f1a68bdf8113f50e779d8158203a4e813b6340dc790f772b3d433ce1c371d5c5f5de46f1a68bdf
    8113f50e779d80f6   

### 4. Generate delegation certificate (pledge)

We have to honor our pledge by delegating at least the pledged amount to our pool, so we have to create a _delegation certificate_ to achieve this:

    cardano-cli shelley stake-address delegation-certificate \
    --stake-verification-key-file stake.vkey \
    --cold-verification-key-file cold.vkey \
    --out-file delegation.cert

This creates a delegation certificate which delegates funds from all stake addresses associated with key `stake.vkey` to
the pool belonging to cold key `cold.vkey`. If we had used different staking keys for the pool owners in the first step,
we would need to create delegation certificates for all of them instead.

### 5. Submit the pool certificate and delegation certificate to the blockchain

Finally we need to submit the pool registration certificate and the delegation certificate(s) to the blockchain by including them in one or more transactions. We can use one transaction for multiple certificates, the certificates will be applied in order.

As before, we start by calculating the fees (as explained [here](040_transactions.md)):

    cardano-cli shelley transaction calculate-min-fee \
    --tx-in-count 1 \
    --tx-out-count 1 \
    --ttl 200000 \
    --testnet-magic 42 \
    --signing-key-file payment.skey \
    --signing-key-file stake.skey \
    --signing-key-file cold.skey \
    --certificate-file pool.cert \
    --certificate-file delegation.cert \
    --protocol-params-file protocol.json

    > 184685

Note how we included the two certificates in the call to `calculate-min-fee` and that the transaction will have to be signed by the payment key corresponding to the address we use to pay for the transaction, the staking key(s) of the owner(s) and the cold key of the node.

We will also have to pay a deposit for the stake pool registration. The deposit amount is specified in the genesis file:

    "poolDeposit": 500000000

to calculate the correct amounts, we first query our address as explained [here](040_transactions.md).

We might get something like

                                TxHash                                 TxIx        Lovelace
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    9db6cf...                                                            0      999999267766

Note that the available funds are higher than the pledge, which is fine. They just must not be _lower_.

In this example, we can now calculate our change:

    expr 999999267766 - 500000000 - 184685
    > 999499083081

Now we can build the transaction:

    cardano-cli shelley transaction build-raw \
    --tx-in 9db6cf...#0 \
    --tx-out $(cat payment.addr)+999499083081 \
    --ttl 200000 \
    --fee 184685 \
    --out-file tx.raw \
    --certificate-file pool.cert \
    --certificate-file delegation.cert

Sign it:

    cardano-cli shelley transaction sign \
    --tx-body-file tx.raw \
    --signing-key-file payment.skey \
    --signing-key-file stake.skey \
    --signing-key-file cold.skey \
    --testnet-magic 42 \
    --out-file tx.signed

And submit:

    cardano-cli shelley transaction submit \
    --tx-file tx.signed \
    --testnet-magic 42

To verify that your stake pool registration was indeed successful, you can perform the following steps:

    cardano-cli shelley stake-pool id --verification-key-file <path to your cold.vkey>

will output your poolID. You can then check for the presence of your poolID in the network ledger state, with the following command:

    cardano-cli shelley query ledger-state --testnet-magic 42 | grep publicKey | grep <poolId>

or 

    cardano-cli shelley query ledger-state --testnet-magic 42 \
    | jq '._delegationState._pstate._pParams.<poolid>' 

which should return a non-empty string if your poolID is located in the ledger. You can then then head over to a pool listing website such as https://ff.pooltool.io/ and (providing it is up and running and showing a list of registered stake pools) you should hopefully be able to find your pool in there by searching using your poolID, and subsequently claiming it (might require registration on the website) and giving it a customized name.
