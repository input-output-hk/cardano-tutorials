# Creating an address

We can use the [command line interface](cli.md)
to create an address,
which will enable us to receive and send ada.

1. First we need to generate an _address key pair_:

        cardano-cli shelley address key-gen \
            --verification-key-file addr.vkey \
            --signing-key-file addr.skey

   This will create two files (here named `addr.vkey` and `addr.skey`),
   one containing the _public verification key_, one the _private signing key_.

   The files are in plain-text format and human readable:

        cat addr.vkey

        > type: VerificationKeyShelley
        > title: Free form text
        > cbor-hex:
        >  18af58...

   The first line describes the file type and should not be changed.
   The second line is a free form text that we could change if we so wished.
   The key itself is the cbor-encoded byte-string in the fourth line.

2. Now we can use the verification key we just created to make an address:

        cardano-cli shelley address build-enterprise \
            --payment-verification-key-file addr.vkey

        > 820658...

  
   It is probably a good idea to store this address in a file:

        cardano-cli shelley address build-enterprise \
            --payment-verification-key-file addr.vkey > addr

   Instead of writing the generated address to the console, 
   this command will store it in file `addr`. 

3. In order to query your address (see the utxo's at that address),
   you first need to set environment variable `CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH`
   to the socket-path specified in your node configuration. In this example we will use
   the block-producing node created in the previous steps:

        export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=~/cardano-node/block-producing/db/node.socket

   and make sure that your node is running.  Then use

        cardano-cli shelley query filtered-utxo \
            --address 820658... \
            --testnet-magic 42

   (The `--testnet-magic 42` is specific to the FF-testnet, for mainnet we would use `--mainnet` instead.)
