# Using the faucet

The faucet allows you to get some "test ada",
so that you can try out features that require funds.

In order to use the faucet, you first need a _payment address_,
which can optionally be associated with a _stake address_.
If you do not have such an address, find out how to create one [here](020_keys_and_addresses.md).

To use the faucet, simply enter

    curl -v -XPOST "https://faucet.ff.dev.cardano.org/send-money/YOUR-ADDRESS

into a terminal window.
If your address is saved to a file, for example `payment.addr`, you can instead type

    curl -v -XPOST "https://faucet.ff.dev.cardano.org/send-money/$(cat payment.addr)"

If all goes well, the last line of the output should declare success and say how much funds where sent to your address.

    *   Trying 3.122.86.4...
    * TCP_NODELAY set
    * Connected to faucet.ff.dev.cardano.org (3.122.86.4) port 443 (#0)
    ...
    * Connection #0 to host faucet.ff.dev.cardano.org left intact
    {"success":true,"amount":1000000000,"fee":168141,"txid":"8ed4383f7af20e81c9cef88b8aab0ff2b1b284dff0ed6614480f8dbfec7d6fb5"}

Now, check the balance of your address to see if you have got the funds:

    export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=~/cardano-node/relay/db/node.socket


Make sure that your node is running.  Then use

    cardano-cli shelley query utxo \
    --address $(cat payment.addr) \
    --testnet-magic 42

You should see something like this:

                              TxHash                                 TxIx        Lovelace

    (Please note: although this command usually completes very quickly, under some conditions it could take severl minutes or even hours to complete.)
